/// This is used to manage the dialogs.
/// The dialog graphs are from NPC class, please look at the class member _dialogGraph.
/// 
/// In addition, you can also add function if you reach to a specific dialog. 
/// To do this, first you need add the function to this script. 
/// Then you need to add the following code in Start function,
/// _dialogBehaviour.BindExternalFunction("Test",Test); 
/// (The string name does not need to be the same as the actual function name but for clarification, just do it like this for now.)
/// Finally, in that DialogNodeGraph you made, you can either add external function attribute and add your function string name from one of the existing Sentence Nodes,
/// OR you can add a external function node.
/// 
/// I have made an example under and also made a DialogNodeGraph in the NPC Dialog Graphs folder.
/// You create DialogNodeGraph by going to Assets/Create/ScriptableObjects/NodeGraph/NodeGraph
/// You can also create Variable Config for uses of DialogNodeGraph by going to Assets/Create/ScriptableObjects/VariableConfig
/// 
/// With this, you can manage variable in DialogNodeGraph.
